heritage %>%
  filter(state == "SC") %>%
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  group_by(year_dedicated) %>%
  count() %>%
  mutate(decade = round(year_dedicated,-1)) %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarise(total_monuments = sum(n))
```

* How many statues remain on public land vs private land?  Is there something uniquely challenging about private land?
```{r}
heritage %>%

    group_by(symbol_type, symbol_category) %>%
    count() %>%
    arrange(symbol_type, symbol_category)
```

```{r}
monument <- heritage %>% 
  filter(symbol_type == "Monument") %>%
  filter(symbol_category == "Monument")
```
